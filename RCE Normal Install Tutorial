(( How to use the executer.))

[ FOR V1.8 ]

Step 1: Make sure Roblox and Rune are both closed.
Step 2: Join the Server-Hop game
Step 3: Open "rune_ce" (not "ROBUX_ARE_A_SCAM")
Step 4: Server-Hop to the game you want to try to exploit
Step 5: Press Enter on the "rune_ce" window (this should open up the modified cheat engine)
Step 6: Press the ComputerIcon Button (it usually has a green-to-red glow around it)
Step 7: Make sure the tab is on "Applications"
Step 8: Double-click Roblox
Step 9: Press Inject
Step 10: If it says "Got Tool: " then the word after that is the tool you need to equip to make the executer pop up.
Step 11: If the executor pops up then have fun.
