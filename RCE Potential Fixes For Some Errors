(( Errored? ))
(Ill keep updating this when I figure out specifically why certain errors happen.)

["You discovered an easteregg! ID:example"]
|
[No clue, rune easter egg i suppose. just retry injecting.]


["An unexpected error occured and Roblox needs to quit. We're Sorry!"]
|
[ByGay was probably detected and Roblox auto-closed. This can also happen if you open ByGay whilst Roblox is open.]


["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:312:"]
|
[This error only happens because the tools in your inventory/backpack/hotbar do not have a "localscript" inside of them
or maybe if you redid it and it worked then the previous injection simply just failed.]


["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:214:" , "\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:295:"]
|
[These errors mainly happens because you have no tools in your inventory/backpack/hotbar]
|
[IF YOURE TRYING TO PLAY BLADEBALL AND ARE GETTING THIS ERROR, YOU NEED TO FOLLOW MY BLADEBALL TUTORIAL STEPS CORRECTLY.]

I HAVE NOT FIGURED OUT FIXES FOR THESE ERRORS:
["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:347:"]
["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:341:"]
["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:140:"]
["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:141:"]
["\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:151:"]
