Step 5: Press Enter on the "rune_ce" window (this should open up the modified cheat engine)

Step 7: Make sure the tab is on "Applications"

(( Errored? ))
(Ill keep updating this when I figure out specifically why certain errors happen.)

"You discovered an easteregg! ID:example"
No clue, rune easter egg i suppose. just retry injecting.


"An unexpected error occured and Roblox needs to quit. We're Sorry!"
ByGay was probably detected and Roblox auto-closed. This can also happen if you open ByGay whilst Roblox is open.


"\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:312:"

This error only happens because the tools in your inventory/backpack/hotbar do not have a "localscript" inside of them
or maybe if you redid it and it worked then the previous injection simply just failed.


"\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:214" , "\ByGay\autorun\roblox.lua:295:"

These errors mainly happens because you have no tools in your inventory/backpack/hotbar
